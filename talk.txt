Owt fer nowt and tuppence change

owt, n. (colloq.) something, anything
nowt, n. (colloq.) nothing
tuppence, n. two pence


The "FOSS" in "FOSS4G" stands for "free and open-source software".

Open-source advocates stress that "free" in "free and open-source software" 
means "free" as in "free speech", not "free" as in "free beer". These two 
meanings are often disambiguated  into the two words "libre" (free speech) and 
"gratis" (free beer). FOSS advocates concentrate on "libre".

Open-source software is "libre" because there are no restrictions. You can do 
what you want with it. Us it to make money. It doesn't do what you need? 
Change it. The "open source" of the software code makes this possible.

Libre. Amazing.

However, I suspect that this viewpoint betrays the great strength of the open-
source community, but which is also one of its key weaknesses: it is driven 
largely by developers. Developers love tweaking software to do something 
different. Before FOSS became so prevalent, opportunities for this were much 
rarer. Developers love "libre".

But.

"Free beer" is underrated.

People like free beer. It's beer, and, which I think is the key point here, 
it's free. It's owt fer nowt.

Because FOSS is gratis:

- anyone across the globe is allowed to use it
- SMEs can use it without breaking the bank
- public sector can put limited public funds to other projects
- students can install it, knowing they won't lose the right to use it on 
  graduation

"Gratis" is what drives uptake of FOSS: NNPA migrated to QGIS, Newcastle City 
Council ditto - driven by saving public money. We certainly were not driven 
by "libre".

As a rule, though, beer is not free (with the possible exception, in 
moderation, of tonight)

That so much is done without money is astonishing, thanks to the enthusiasm 
and commitment of contributors:

- coding
- testing
- documentation
- translation

But without money, many things would simply be impossible:

- boring coding
- boring testing
- boring documentation
- boring translation

Alongside this, the best efforts cannot make some things free, such as 
reliable hosting, and conferences such as this.

So, to quote Bob Geldof:

JUST GIVE US YER FOSSIN' MONEY

- pay for a feature or a fix
- donate
- crowdfund
- become a patron (Regina Obe on Patreon)
- sponsor

This money drives quality and professional output. It pays for features via 
grants, and for professional bugfixing. Give what you can.

But let's bring this back to gratis: you can still get owt fer nowt. But 
that's all ye get. If you don't contribute (money, expertise, time), please 
don't complain or demand. Complaints and demands are tuppence change. If you 
want to demand or complain, pay a developer.

But if you want owt fer nowt, ye divven' get tuppence change.
