"Something for nothing, and more besides"


As we all know, the "FOSS" in "FOSS4G" stands for "free and open-source 
software".

Open-source advocates often rightly stress that the "free" in "FOSS" means 
"free" as in "free speech", not "free" as in "free beer". The two meanings of 
"free" are often made clear by explicitly using the two words "libre" (free 
speech) and "gratis" (free beer). Open-source advocates often rightly 
concentrate on "libre".

Open-source software is "libre" because there are no restrictions. You are 
free to do what you want with it. Use it to make money. It doesn't do what you 
need? Change it. The "open source" of the software makes this possible.

But here's the thing:

"Free beer" is underrated.

People like free beer. It's beer, and, which I think is the key point here, 
it's free. Free beer is owt fer nowt.

"Gratis" is what drives uptake of FOSS: NNPA migrated to QGIS, Newcastle City 
Council have done the same - driven by saving public money. We certainly were 
not driven by the fact that QGIS was "libre", but because it was "gratis". Owt 
fer nowt.

As a rule, though, free beer is not free - tonight's free beer has been paid 
for by our fabulous sponsors (thank you), and by you, our fabulous delegates 
(thank you).

That so much is done without money is astonishing, thanks to the enthusiasm 
and commitment of contributors. But without money, many things would simply be 
impossible, such as conferences such as this and, more importantly, the 
enterprise-grade performance and stability we enjoy in FOSS4G software such as 
PostGIS, GeoServer, and QGIS.

So, to quote Bob Geldof:

JUST GIVE US YER FOSSIN' MONEY

You can do this in many ways:

- donate
- pay for a feature or a fix
- contribute to a crowdfund (Lutra, developing QGIS 3D)
- become a patron (Regina Obe on Patreon - maintaining, developing, 
                   and documenting PostGIS)
- take out a support contract with one of the amazing companies who offer them 
  (speak to some of them here tonight and tomorrow)
- sponsor

This money drives quality and professional output. It pays for features via 
grants, and for professional bugfixing. Give what you can, if you can.

But you don't *have* to give anything. You can still get owt fer nowt. But if 
you don't pay, owt fer nowt is all ye get. You don't get to complain or 
demand, or expect. Complaints, demands, and expectations are tuppence change. 
If you want to demand or complain, pay a developer. If not, approach things 
differently:
 
 - don't complain, contribute
 - don't demand, discuss
 - don't expect, engage

But if you want owt fer nowt, ye divven' get tuppence change.
